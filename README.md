## I am building an online directory of resources. Resources to help develop the next generation of coders. Current categories include:

- Books
- Toys
- Courses
- Kits
- Learning Platforms
- Organizations
- Supplies
- Apps

### While I could do this on my own, I would love some help! There are lots of ways you can help. Iâ€™m hoping to connect with people/companies who are interested in:

- helping with site/theme development
- donating resources like hosting
- donating/sharing plugin licenses
- content entry
- sponsoring the project in any way
- site design

##  Contact me at hello@kidscodeforcecom to learn more or get involved.
